BUGS
----
the right panel scrollbar does not appear when the action buttons exceed the page height
	or does it...? perhaps just not on page loading

tooltips which have their offset adjusted after the load event of a contained image appear to jump sideways
	try positioning within the window once before awaiting the load events

if the developer tools are opened and then closed, the topPanelHeight is incorrect after the resize event

TO DO
-----
have a slight delay before displaying full cards in the player discard pile

event cards' "play at any time" should have a tooltip that describes exactly when they can be played

in the discard prompt, give the x/y a red or green background with white text instead of colored text

the infection rate tooltip should indicate that epidemics increase the infection rate

bottom panel elements should be positioned in way that's similar to the event history container
	consider using position: fixed
	pieces should appear behind the bottom panel elements

when at risk of defeat, warn the players somehow...
	when a cube supply gets low, its count should glow red
	when few player cards are left in the deck, show a warning
	the outbreaks marker should glow red when approaching the last space on the track

when a button is disabled, change the cursor or something

indicate loading when waiting for a response from the server

starting a new game
	select difficulty
	select roles?
when the game is over
	navigate back to home screen

menu
	rules / instructions / FAQ
	resign button

event history
	game end icon and details
	travel paths for movement actions and research station relocations?
	outbreak spread paths?

handle errors
	retrieveEventHistory

add tests

make sure things look ok for different screen sizes

for multiplayer games, require permission for certain actions
	share knowledge
	dispatch pawn
	airlift

IDEAS
-----
consider removing the special actions container
	dispatch pawn and operations flight are movement actions
	plan contingency is an other action

the 'choose flight type' interface should provide only the flight type options with descriptions viewable on hover
	when a flight type is selected, the normal action interface should be displayed

display difficulty on board above infection rate

change "x actions remaining" to 4 lights which turn off as actions are used

hovering over the quarantine specialist's pawn should display the quarantine area
	role tag also?

instead of the disease cube background, try a 1px drop shadow filter

when stacking outbreak infection cubes on the origin city, use placeDiseaseCubes to animate them one at a time
	use the destinationKeys as a param to give them that data attribute
	OR...
	allow the existing cubes to be passed to placeDiseaseCubes as an argument

trophy background or those fern things around the text on the victory screen
skull background or something for defeat screen

pinpointing should happen on mousover of playercards/infection cards?

have an explicit rendezvous action button and prompt?

access epidemicsDrawn, infectionRate, and numOutbreaks from vw_disease?

add the "async" suffix to async function names?

include country name and population for infection cards?

centralize event types in a php file?

split data.currentStep into an object containing 'next' and 'current' keys

SMALL FIXES
-----------
when prompting infect, indicate that event cards can be played

during the infection step, if an infection card has already been drawn...
	one quiet night is not playable, therefore the remaining infections should happen automatically
	if oqn is the only event card held

special action button tooltips should have role names replaced by role tags

put strings in strings.js file
	game end cause descriptions

role cards should be positioned with positioTooltipRelativeToElement

event history button background-color should transition

instead of importing gameData at the top of event.js, try dynamically importing only where it is needed

perhaps epidemic intensify events should be undoable until an infection has occured

when the only infection discard is removed, the top of the removed cards container should stay aligned with the bottom of the top panel.

eventTypes that are actions should have a getActionButton method

center gameEnd text vertically

use a more straightforward way of retrieving the turn order in retrieveGameData.php

show outbreak symbol on outbreaking city

One Quiet Night should notify success in a more visible way

Resilient Population animation looks a little funny when very few cards (3ish or fewer) are in the discard pile

make DiscardPrompt a singleton

reduce the number of arguments in php function definitions (pass objects instead?)

pawns should have a data-key property instead of a cityKey class

instead of counting the cubes on the board, keep a cubeCount column in the game table

do steps need a procedure? perhaps they only need a single method

replace php associative arrays with objects

use fetch instead of ajax

use em instead of px for font sizes?

use css variables for colors n stuff

private properties in objects?
use Object.freeze() on objects that should never change?

consider using a locationID instead of cityKey + gameID
