BUGS
----
the right panel scrollbar does not appear when the action buttons exceed the page height
	or does it...? perhaps just not on page loading

the infection rate tooltip within the indicator container is not hoverable

at the very start of a game, the undo action button tooltip says '"Initial Infection" events cannot be undone'

after undoing the discard event which preceded a skipped Infect Cities step,
	the Infect Cities play step should indicate that One Quiet Night will occur that turn
		additionally, after the Infect Cities play step should be updated after undoing One Quiet Night

TO DO
-----
loading gifs should appear after a short delay (if the connection is fast enough, they will not appear at all)

if flight options are presented
	disable/gray out the ones that weren't used

test...
	outbreaks caused by infect city
	game end conditions
	the infect cities loading gif when auto-infecting single/multiple
	operations flight
	dispatch

show loading gif for
	automatic events
		infect city
		epidemic
			increase
			infect
			intensify
			next


after loading for x ms, show some error message

account creation
	button to check username availability
	show password strength with each keypress

main menu
	if a game associated with the access key is in progress, give the options: resume / new game
	role selection -- perhaps this can be saved for last since random roles is fine
		use + / - buttons to add and remove roles
		show a pawn for each role
		when 'randomize roles' is checked, show pawns with "?" on them

load other js files only when necessary

when a city or contained piece is hovered, show the city name in a larger font

starting a new game
	select difficulty
	select roles?
when the game is over
	navigate back to home screen

menu
	rules / instructions / FAQ
	resign button

event history
	game end icon and details
	travel paths for movement actions and research station relocations?
	outbreak spread paths?

handle errors
	if the game is not set, redirect to either home or login
	retrieveEventHistory

add tests

make sure things look ok for different screen sizes

cross-browser compatabililty
	animations
	css
		calc variants

index
	access key verification
	allow access keys to be requested
	tab / enter key bindings

for multiplayer games, require permission for certain actions
	share knowledge
	dispatch pawn
	airlift

IDEAS
-----
consider removing the special actions container
	dispatch pawn and operations flight are movement actions
	plan contingency is an other action

the 'choose flight type' interface should provide only the flight type options with descriptions viewable on hover
	when a flight type is selected, the normal action interface should be displayed

display difficulty on board above infection rate

change "x actions remaining" to 4 lights which turn off as actions are used

hovering over the quarantine specialist's pawn should display the quarantine area
	role tag also?

instead of the disease cube background, try a 1px drop shadow filter

when stacking outbreak infection cubes on the origin city, use placeDiseaseCubes to animate them one at a time
	use the destinationKeys as a param to give them that data attribute
	OR...
	allow the existing cubes to be passed to placeDiseaseCubes as an argument

trophy background or those fern things around the text on the victory screen
skull background or something for defeat screen

pinpointing should happen on mousover of playercards/infection cards?

have an explicit rendezvous action button and prompt?

access epidemicsDrawn, infectionRate, and numOutbreaks from vw_disease?

add the "async" suffix to async function names?

include country name and population for infection cards?

centralize event types in a php file?

split data.currentStep into an object containing 'next' and 'current' keys

SMALL FIXES
-----------
if auto-infecting cities, fetch all infections in one request

use Promise.resolve() instead of Return new Promise...

indicate loading when waiting for a response from the server
	notify when the response is taking too long

disable tooltips when a game-end condition is reached

if the event history will scroll to within a few pixels of the start or end, it should just go all the way

when prompting infect, indicate that event cards can be played

during the infection step, if an infection card has already been drawn...
	one quiet night is not playable, therefore the remaining infections should happen automatically
	if oqn is the only event card held

special action button tooltips should have role names replaced by role tags

put strings in strings.js file
	game end cause descriptions

role cards should be positioned with positioTooltipRelativeToElement

event history button background-color should transition

instead of importing gameData at the top of event.js, try dynamically importing only where it is needed

perhaps epidemic intensify events should be undoable until an infection has occured

when the only infection discard is removed, the top of the removed cards container should stay aligned with the bottom of the top panel.

eventTypes that are actions should have a getActionButton method

center gameEnd text vertically

use a more straightforward way of retrieving the turn order in retrieveGameData.php

show outbreak symbol on outbreaking city

One Quiet Night should notify success in a more visible way

Resilient Population animation looks a little funny when very few cards (3ish or fewer) are in the discard pile

reduce the number of arguments in php function definitions (pass objects instead?)

pawns should have a data-key property instead of a cityKey class

instead of counting the cubes on the board, keep a cubeCount column in the game table

do steps need a procedure? perhaps they only need a single method

replace php associative arrays with objects

use fetch instead of ajax

use em instead of px for font sizes?

use css variables for colors n stuff

private properties in objects?
use Object.freeze() on objects that should never change?

consider using a locationID instead of cityKey + gameID
