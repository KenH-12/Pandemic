BUGS
----
quarantine event icons get the wrong file extension -- export them as pngs

drive/ferry icon is huge in action prompt

TO DO
-----
event history
	slideshow buttons
	detailed tooltips
		initial infections
		starting hands?
		turn order?
		other setup stuff?
		auto-treat disease
		eradication
		pass
			"â€”" icon
			number of actions forfeited
		game end
		hoverable --- for the below descriptions, consider linking to a certain place in a rules file
			Title should show action description
			role tags should show role card to right of tooltip
			city cards should pinpoint location
			event cards should show description
			dotted underline for
				city names (pinpoint city)
				movement types (dispatch pawn)
			travel paths for movement actions and research station relocations
			epidemic intensify should have a max height, and should be scrollable
	new icons should not appear prematurely
	if the event history is not overflowing horizontally, animate new icons into view from right to left

replace event.code with instanceof Event

move data.eventCards to eventCards.js ?

create MovementEvent class as a bridge between Event and all movement action event types

hovering over an epidemic card should show the full card

when a piece lands behind part of a playerPanel, the panel should become transparent

undo actions

the resilient population animation should scroll the infection discards container to the bottom
before placing the card in the "removed from game" container

find some other way to convey that the cost of some actions is to discard whichever card(s)
	e.g. "Cost:"

the pinpointers should appear behind...
	the player deck container
	the rs supply
	the event history

rendezvous button

rules / instructions / FAQ

consider using the Researcher's modifications on the Share Knowledge button
when another player can take from the researcher

standardize prompt appearance / button behaviour

resign button

compare client and server side hand sizes after drawing?

rename the step indicator or whatever it's called

handle errors
	retrieveEventHistory

add tests

include recently dealt infection cards / cardbacks in the resize event

make sure things look ok for different screen sizes

for multiplayer games, require permission for certain actions
	share knowledge
	dispatch pawn
	airlift

TO TEST
-------
make sure the height limit on the expanded infection discards functions properly, including the scrolling

IDEAS
-----
make the current play step glow

skippable infection steps and epidemics

hovering over the quarantine specialist's pawn should display the quarantine area
	role tag also?

instead of the disease cube background, try a 1px drop shadow filter

when stacking outbreak infection cubes on the origin city, use placeDiseaseCubes to animate them one at a time
	use the destinationKeys as a param to give them that data attribute
	OR...
	allow the existing cubes to be passed to placeDiseaseCubes as an argument

trophy background or those fern things around the text on the victory screen
skull background or something for defeat screen

hovering over the player deck causes the cursor to become a "?".
	clicking shows the explaination of what happens when the cards run out.

pinpointing should happen on mousover of playercards/infection cards?

have an explicit rendezvous action button and prompt?

concede button?

perhaps the discard prompt should be in the player's hand

have dragged pawns leave translucent duplicates that remain in the pawn's current location
have an arrow between the pawn and the DestinationKeys
	it should follow the dragged pawn's translucent image

store eventTypeInfo in db?

to keep the player panels from covering any cities, consider checking the bottom-right corner of the far-right panel
	if it's past a certain top/left percentage, reduce the width of .player and/or the height of contained elements

use dotted underlines with the "?" cursor and a tooltip on mouseover to explain things that may be unclear

instead of the space-consuming title, "RESEARCH STATION SUPPLY", use the station img as the title?

access epidemicsDrawn, infectionRate, and numOutbreaks from vw_disease?

animate outbreakInfection cubes to the origin city first, then to the affected city. (more intuitive change in cube supply)

add the "async" suffix to async function names?

display checkboxes beside epidemic steps

include the "play" steps from the board beside the player deck or somewhere

prompt the player to draw cards instead of dealing them automatically ?

include country name and population for infection cards?

centralize event types in a php file?

when retrieving events / eventHistory, parse events into more useful objects based on their type?

animate color on buttons that are waiting to be clicked ('continue' buttons)

split data.currentStep into an object containing 'next' and 'current' keys

in the discard prompt, give the x/y a red or green background with white text instead of colored text

SMALL FIXES
-----------
eventTypes that are actions should have a getActionButton method

center gameEnd text vertically

use a more straightforward way of retrieving the turn order in retrieveGameData.php

use flexbox for #playerPanelContainer

show outbreak symbol on outbreaking city

One Quiet Night should notify success in a more visible way

Resilient Population animation looks a little funny when very few cards (3ish or fewer) are in the discard pile

make DiscardPrompt a singleton

infection cards should scroll with their container (forecast is an obvious example when there is overflow)

reduce the number of arguments in php function definitions (pass objects instead?)

there should be some message below the active role that says a request is being processed

when event cards cannot be played, the epidemic infect step should happen automatically

event cards' "play at any time" should have a tooltip that describes exactly when they can be played.

pawns should have a data-key property instead of a cityKey class

put a cancel button at the top of the action prompt?

instead of counting the cubes on the board, keep a cubeCount column in the game table

do steps need a procedure? perhaps they only need a single method

for the valid[eventType.name]DestinationKeys methods, use camelcase eventType names.

in the discard prompts (like discover cure) the card text is weirdly large and pixellated

use a similar draggable approach to pawn dragging?

bindDiseaseCubeEvents should be 2 separate functions -- 1 to enable and 1 to disable

for any array containing only unique values, use a Set instead

in the arrangePlayerCards procedure, change the way epidemic division remainders are handled
	make it randomly choose whether to use a remainder for each division.

flip pawn images horizontally to make the lighting consistent with the research stations

for the epidemic infect step, make sure the card looks like it's coming from the bottom of the deck

the stored procedure increment_gamephase...
	should only work for actions 1-4
	should be renamed to nextActionStep or similar.

facedown infectioncards need to be repositioned by resizeBoard

contingency planner's color should be slightly darker to contrast the board and the white text
dark gray background areas should be slighty lighter to contrast black cards

ensure that the game initiated properly

replace php associative arrays with objects

discard panels should have a greater z-index than pieces (except pawns that are being dragged)

implement a constant duration for panel slide up/down

in php files, put $game not found and such at the top instead of nesting everything

create a js function that performs data.events.push and updates the nextEventIndex

include a step description in the db that can be used in the status

create a function, getDuration, to handle the fast forwarding mechanic

prevent pinpoint rectangles from triggering mouse events -- they mess with the discard pile hovers

consider changing the color of the bottom panel -- black discards blend in

use fetch instead of ajax

modules

contingency planner's pawn is hard to see -- make it slightly darker?

use em instead of px for font sizes?

use css variables for colors n stuff

not enough space for initial infections at smallest screen width (playerPanel gets in the way)

some city coords are not centred

create trigger that updates a card's index after updating its location
in movementAction.php and drawPlayerCards.php, set the cardIndex of discarded cards
also allow players to rearrange their hands. update cardIndex to reflect the hand order.

check rows returned or whatever in php files

private properties in objects?
use Object.freeze() on objects that should never change?

consider using a locationID instead of cityKey + gameID

probably don't need getDisplayName
