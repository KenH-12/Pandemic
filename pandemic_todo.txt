BUGS
----
sometimes hovering over a special ability tag causes the action buttons to become visible

ensure consistency of cube counts (cities have had outbreaks showing 2 cubes)
	solved after QS outbreak issue was solved?
	if it happens when the QS is not in the game, fix it.

"hand limit reached but cards are inconsistent"
	which possibly means cardKeys are not added/removed properly somewhere
	this happened after share knowledge
		ways that players can pick up / discard:
			starting hands
			draw cards w/ epidemic(s)
			hand limit discard
			build research station
			discover cure
			dispatch df
		
		confirmed working:
			draw cards w/o epidemics
			draw cards w/ epidemic
			charter flight
			direct flight
			share knowledge give/receive
			dispatch cf
			discard
			play event card

clicking "DISCARD" on the df prompt cause movementAction to promptdf again with the destination, eventType, and waitingForConfirmation = true.

discard step failed to getPlayerWithTooManyCards (8 cards)

TO DO
-----
provide descriptions as to why action buttons are disabled

cube animation time/easing feels a little weird

use cursor: grab for draggables

cure special event timing between the banner and the cure vial seems weird

infection prevention animations are too long, especially when they occur frequently like quarantine

in action prompts that show the special ability tag, make below text look more closely related to the tag

immediately reveal forecasted cards after the facedown animation finishes

when playercards are animated to the hand, the line-height of the card text seems off

add a glowing arrow over the active player's pawn
	when the dispatcher is active, add smaller glowing arrows over all other pawns

standardize prompt appearance / button behaviour

highlight the active pawn in some way

clicking on a player's role in the player panel should pinpoint their pawn's location
clicking on an infection card in the discard pile should pinpoint the city

add tooltip for "eradicated" in discover cure and treat disease prompts

when government grant is prompted, the research station supply should glow.
	unless a station needs to be relocated

resign button

compare client and server side hand sizes after drawing?

rename the step indicator or whatever it's called

handle errors
	retrieveEventHistory

add tests

make sure things look ok for different screen sizes

for multiplayer games, require permission for certain actions
	share knowledge
	dispatch pawn
	airlift

TO TEST
-------
make sure the height limit on the expanded infection discards functions properly, including the scrolling

IDEAS
-----
when stacking outbreak infection cubes on the origin city, use placeDiseaseCubes to animate them one at a time
	use the destinationKeys as a param to give them that data attribute
	OR...
	allow the existing cubes to be passed to placeDiseaseCubes as an argument

trophy background or those fern things around the text on the victory screen
skull background or something for defeat screen

hovering over the player deck causes the cursor to become a "?".
	clicking shows the explaination of what happens when the cards run out.

pinpointing should happen on mousover of playercards/infection cards?

have an explicit rendezvous action button and prompt?

concede button?

perhaps the discard prompt should be in the player's hand

have dragged pawns leave translucent duplicates that remain in the pawn's current location
have an arrow between the pawn and the DestinationKeys
	it should follow the dragged pawn's translucent image

store eventTypeInfo in db?

to keep the player panels from covering any cities, consider checking the bottom-right corner of the far-right panel
	if it's past a certain top/left percentage, reduce the width of .player and/or the height of contained elements

use dotted underlines with the "?" cursor and a tooltip on mouseover to explain things that may be unclear

in the treat disease selection menu, replace the large cubes with actual disease icons?

instead of the space-consuming title, "RESEARCH STATION SUPPLY", use the station img as the title?

access epidemicsDrawn, infectionRate, and numOutbreaks from vw_disease?

animate outbreakInfection cubes to the origin city first, then to the affected city. (more intuitive change in cube supply)

add the "async" suffix to async function names?

display checkboxes beside epidemic steps

include the "play" steps from the board beside the player deck or somewhere

prompt the player to draw cards instead of dealing them automatically ?

include country name and population for infection cards?

centralize event types in a php file?

when retrieving events / eventHistory, parse events into more useful objects based on their type?

animate color on buttons that are waiting to be clicked ('continue' buttons)

split data.currentStep into an object containing 'next' and 'current' keys

make animation effects juicier
	disease cube size bounce when adding to or taking from the cube supply

SMALL FIXES
-----------
center gameEnd text vertically

use a more straightforward way of retrieving the turn order in retrieveGameData.php

use flexbox for #playerPanelContainer

show outbreak symbol on outbreaking city

One Quiet Night should notify success in a more visible way

Resilient Population animation looks a little funny when very few cards (3ish or fewer) are in the discard pile

make DiscardPrompt a singleton

infection cards should scroll with their container (forecast is an obvious example when there is overflow)

reduce the number of arguments in php function definitions (pass objects instead?)

there should be some message below the active role that says a request is being processed

when event cards cannot be played, the epidemic infect step should happen automatically

event cards' "play at any time" should have a tooltip that describes exactly when they can be played.

pawns should have a data-key property instead of a cityKey class

put a cancel button at the top of the action prompt?

instead of counting the cubes on the board, keep a cubeCount column in the game table

do steps need a procedure? perhaps they only need a single method

for the valid[eventType.name]DestinationKeys methods, use camelcase eventType names.

in the discard prompts (like discover cure) the card text is weirdly large and pixellated

use a similar draggable approach to pawn dragging?

bindDiseaseCubeEvents should be 2 separate functions -- 1 to enable and 1 to disable

for any array containing only unique values, use a Set instead

in the arrangePlayerCards procedure, change the way epidemic division remainders are handled
	make it randomly choose whether to use a remainder for each division.

flip pawn images horizontally to make the lighting consistent with the research stations

for the epidemic infect step, make sure the card looks like it's coming from the bottom of the deck

the stored procedure increment_gamephase...
	should only work for actions 1-4
	should be renamed to nextActionStep or similar.

facedown infectioncards need to be repositioned by resizeBoard

center disease color options in treat disease prompt

contingency planner's color should be slightly darker to contrast the board and the white text
dark gray background areas should be slighty lighter to contrast black cards

ensure that the game initiated properly

replace php associative arrays with objects

discard panels should have a greater z-index than pieces (except pawns that are being dragged)

implement a constant duration for panel slide up/down

in php files, put $game not found and such at the top instead of nesting everything

create a js function that performs data.events.push and updates the nextEventIndex

include a step description in the db that can be used in the status

create a function, getDuration, to handle the fast forwarding mechanic

prevent pinpoint rectangles from triggering mouse events -- they mess with the discard pile hovers

consider changing the color of the bottom panel -- black discards blend in

use fetch instead of ajax

modules

contingency planner's pawn is hard to see -- make it slightly darker?

use em instead of px for font sizes?

use css variables for colors n stuff

not enough space for initial infections at smallest screen width (playerPanel gets in the way)

some city coords are not centred

fix z-index of pinpointers as it relates to pawns, cubes, and stations

create trigger that updates a card's index after updating its location
in movementAction.php and drawPlayerCards.php, set the cardIndex of discarded cards
also allow players to rearrange their hands. update cardIndex to reflect the hand order.

check rows returned or whatever in php files

private properties in objects?
use Object.freeze() on objects that should never change?

consider using a locationID instead of cityKey + gameID

probably don't need getDisplayName
